<strong> Episode Ideas: </strong>
<p><br>
:confetti_ball: The Claw Game of Life (Note: Not fully fleshed out.) - On a school trip to the bowling alley, the preschoolers become embroiled in a rigged Claw game containing a very desirable item. As they try to tip the game in their favor and distract the adults enough to keep them away from the machine, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan work on an insanely frustrating bureaucratic matter while they are bowling.

<p><br>
Pitbull Vag - As Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan walk back home after a trip to the store, they see a pitbull's swollen vulva. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephesto accidently posions South Park's water supply with a chemical concoction that causes the town to grow tails that display emotional arousal from behind. As those who were born without penises learn to cope with this public display, those who are habituated to the phenomenon look for looser pants. All returns to normal when enough medical staff are on deck to remove the apendages.

Helicopter Parent Money/"That preschool? More like a future C student school." - Butters develops an educational program that promises parents their toddler will earn a spot at the region's top pre-school. He is happy to take their endless piles of cash and tolerate their constant meddling until he finds the toddlers are not only miserable but lack motivation. After he discovers determination is the most important predictor of future success, he ends the program. Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan begin to see the people sitting in their cars everywhere and decide to investigate. (Note: The episode may not need the B plot, making fun of helicopter parenting could sustain a full episode.)

Scrying the Future of Office Work - As the girls of South Park enjoy the witchy looks of TikTok, a strange phenomena occurs over Stark's Pond on a dark, moonless night which becomes associated with the young ladies after a town meeting addresses the incident. As the girls try to defend themselves, they discover a group of disgruntled employees being mandated to come back to the office are responsible for the miscalculated, explosive incident.
</br></p>
<p><br>
Letters of Resignation - As the two J's, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, walk away from Garrison in a "Is that semen on your black eye?" kind of way, someone close to the case leaks security camera footage, cut similar to a hybrid of Cheaters and Catfish, presenting Garrison compulsively using psychologically manipulative tactics on his faithful legal team. Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan enlist Butters to figure out Dougie's living situation after realizing they have never seen his parents.
</br></p>
<p><br>
About as Bad as Smoking/"About as bad as smoking but better than risking abuse by all the horrible shitheads currently out there." - As doctors warn everyone about the dangers of loneliness, videos and stories of garbage humans attacking other people surface all over the internet.
