Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan enlist Butters to figure out Dougie's living situation after realizing they have never seen his parents.

:smoking: About as Bad as Smoking/"About as bad as smoking but better than risking abuse by all the horrible shitheads currently out there." - As doctors warn everyone about the dangers of loneliness, videos and stories of garbage humans attacking other people surface all over the internet.
