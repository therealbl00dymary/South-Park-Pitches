<strong> Episode Ideas: </strong>
<p><br>
:school_satchel: Helicopter Parent Money/"That preschool? More like a future C student school." - Butters develops an educational program that promises parents their toddler will earn a spot at the region's top pre-school. He is happy to take their endless piles of cash and tolerate their constant meddling until he finds the toddlers are not only miserable but lack motivation. After he discovers determination is the most important predictor of future success, he ends the program. Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan begin to see the people sitting in their cars everywhere and decide to investigate. (Note: The episode may not need the B plot, making fun of helicopter parenting could sustain a full episode.)

Letters of Resignation - As the two J's, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, walk away from Garrison in a "Is that semen on your black eye?" kind of way, someone close to the case leaks security camera footage, cut similar to a hybrid of Cheaters and Catfish, presenting Garrison compulsively using psychologically manipulative tactics on his faithful legal team. Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan enlist Butters to figure out Dougie's living situation after realizing they have never seen his parents.
