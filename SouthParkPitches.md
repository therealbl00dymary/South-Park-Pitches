<strong> Episode Ideas: </strong>

	<!-- A tasteful way to talk about the struggles of having a penis. FYI,I never had a penis so maybe this concept sucks? -->
Pitbull Vag - As Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan walk back home after a trip to the store, they see a pitbull's swollen vulva. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephesto accidently posions South Park's water supply with a chemical concoction that causes the town to grow tails that display emotional arousal from behind. As those who were born without penises learn to cope with this public display, those who are habituated to the phenomenon look for looser pants. All returns to normal when enough medical staff are on deck to remove the apendages.

Helicopter Parent Money/"That preschool? More like a future C student school." - Butters develops an educational program that promises parents their toddler will earn a spot at the region's top pre-school. He is happy to take their endless piles of cash and tolerate their constant meddling until he finds the toddlers are not only miserable but lack motivation. After he discovers determination is the most important predictor of future success, he ends the program. Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan begin to see the people sitting in their cars everywhere and decide to investigate. (Note: The episode may not need the B plot, making fun of helicopter parenting could sustain a full episode.)
