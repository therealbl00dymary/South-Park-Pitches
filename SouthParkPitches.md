<strong> Episode Ideas: </strong>

:crystal_ball: Scrying the Future of Office Work - As the girls of South Park enjoy the witchy looks of TikTok, a strange phenomena occurs over Stark's Pond on a dark, moonless night which becomes associated with the young ladies after a town meeting addresses the incident. As the girls try to defend themselves, they discover a group of disgruntled employees being mandated to come back to the office are responsible for the miscalculated, explosive incident.

:mailbox_with_mail: Letters of Resignation - As the two J's, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, walk away from Garrison in a "Is that semen on your black eye?" kind of way, someone close to the case leaks security camera footage, cut similar to a hybrid of Cheaters and Catfish, presenting Garrison compulsively using psychologically manipulative tactics on his faithful legal team. Meanwhile, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Stan enlist Butters to figure out Dougie's living situation after realizing they have never seen his parents.

:candy: "Suffering from Internet-Induced Brain Rot?" Drug Marketing/Designer Drug Game - America's most ethical drug company has finally discovered a cure! And they've recruited you to market the drug! Sounds lame? Fuck you! Choose the name, state (solid or liquid), pill or container shape, color, and ingestion method. After crafting the future best seller, it's commercial time! Choose your actor(s), clich√© dialog, highlighted symptoms, and, of course, side effects. Share your abomination on social media and make the dreams of shareholders looking for the next OxyContin come true! (Note: Did anyone play with 'theatrical production' software like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Night_(video_game)">Opening Night</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Girls_Premiere">American Girl Premiere</a>, and <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/spider-man-cartoon-maker-cnq">Spider-Man Cartoon Maker</a> when they were younger? I could f*ck with that shit for <i>hours</i>. My friends and I would end up crying we laughed so hard.)
